# GPU Passthrough Configuration
###############################################################################
# Configure GPU passthrough for Host and Guest.
#
# TODO(role): This was originally in the 'debian' role but likely should be in
#     it's own role specifically for GPU passthrough. Leave here until it is
#     decided, but disable.
#
# Reference:
# * https://wiki.debian.org/NvidiaGraphicsDrivers

# Enable GPU passthrough.
#
# Enables configuration of GPU passthrough. This should only be enabled on
# nodes where passthrough is used. Enabling passthrough will automatically
# enable 'non-free' and 'backport' repositories. Node will be rebooted
# automatically on a configuration change which installs or changes devices.
#
# Default: False.
os_gpu_passthrough: false

# GPU passthrough mode.
#
# Values:
#    host: configure GPU passthrough as host (machine with hardware GPU)
#   guest: configure GPU passthrough as guest (machine without hardware GPU)
#
# Default: 'guest'.
os_gpu_passthrough_mode: 'guest'

# GPU brand.
#
# Values:
#   nvidia: nvidia-based card supported in nivida-driver packages
#      amd: amd-based card supported in mesa-vulkan packages
#    intel: intel-based iGPU support
#
# Default: 'nvidia'.
os_gpu_brand: 'nvidia'

# GPU driver version to use.
#
# Hosts and Guests should use the same driver version.
#
# Partial versions may be used (automatically globbed at the end). Recommend
# specifying the major version and using the built in globbing for minor
# version updates.
#
# If the nvidia-smi check fails when executing the role, the version specified
# is no longer available upstream, use a newer version.
#
# Default: '470'.
os_gpu_driver: '470'
